    <h1>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h1>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the core technologies for building websites. HTML structures the content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivity. Together, they create dynamic web pages. This page covers their histories and how they function.</p>
    
    <h2>History of HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 at CERN. It was designed to share scientific documents over the internet. The first version, HTML 1.0, was released in 1993. It evolved with versions like HTML 2.0 (1995) and HTML 4.01 (1999). HTML5, introduced in 2014, added features for multimedia and better structure. Today, it's the standard for web content.</p>
    
    <h2>History of CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994 to separate content from design. The first version, CSS1, came out in 1996, focusing on fonts and colors. CSS2 in 1998 added layouts and media types. CSS3, developed from 1999 onward, introduced modules for animations and responsive design. It allows websites to look consistent across devices.</p>
    
    <h2>History of JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 at Netscape. Originally called Mocha, then LiveScript, it was renamed JavaScript to ride on Java's popularity. It was standardized as ECMAScript in 1997. JavaScript evolved with versions like ES6 (2015), adding features for modern web apps. It's now used for both client-side and server-side development.</p>
    
    <h2>How HTML Works</h2>
    <p>HTML uses tags to structure web content. For example, &lt;h1&gt; for headings, &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs, and &lt;a&gt; for links. Browsers read HTML and display it as a webpage. It's like the skeleton of a site, defining elements without styling.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Structure:</strong> Starts with &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;, then &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt; tags.</li>
        <li><strong>Elements:</strong> Tags like &lt;div&gt; group content, and attributes add details (e.g., href in links).</li>
        <li><strong>Semantics:</strong> HTML5 tags like &lt;header&gt; and &lt;article&gt; make content meaningful for search engines.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How CSS Works</h2>
    <p>CSS styles HTML elements by applying rules. A rule has a selector (e.g., h1) and declarations (e.g., color: blue). It can be inline, internal, or external. CSS controls layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Selectores:</strong> Target elements by tag, class (.class), or ID (#id).</li>
        <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Like margin, padding, background, and flexbox for layouts.</li>
        <li><strong>Cascading:</strong> Rules inherit and override based on specificity and order.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How JavaScript Works</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that runs in the browser. It manipulates HTML and CSS dynamically. For example, it can change text on a button click or fetch data from servers. It's event-driven and uses APIs for interactions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Variables and Functions:</strong> Store data and define reusable code.</li>
        <li><strong>DOM Manipulation:</strong> Accesses and changes webpage elements via the Document Object Model.</li>
        <li><strong>Events:</strong> Responds to user actions like clicks or scrolls.</li>
        <li><strong>Asynchronous Code:</strong> Handles tasks like loading data without freezing the page.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How They Work Together</h2>
    <p>HTML provides structure, CSS adds style, and JavaScript enables interaction. For instance, HTML creates a button, CSS makes it look nice, and JavaScript makes it functional. This trio powers modern web development, from simple blogs to complex apps.</p>
